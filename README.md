Sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify region of similarity that may
be a consequence of functional. structural or evolutionary relationship between differentn species.

Global alignment attempts to align every residue in every sequence. It is most useful when trying to align sequences 
that are similar and almost equal in size.

**The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm** is most common algorithm used to align protein or nucleotide sequence. It is one of the
first application of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences.
